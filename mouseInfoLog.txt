"The campus has been the second home for me. I realised this when the first semester was half way through.  Post realisation, I have done everything in my power to give back to the campus. Budding from a background in leadership as the school’s head boy to the several PORs achieved in IIIT Delhi, I am set on the path to contribute back to the campus through the student council while sharpening these leadership qualities. The ability to organise events and take last second decisions have been developed due to the start-ups me and my co-founders have established. The base for the same has been through working with several clubs to organise events (LDA, IRC, OWASP to name a few). Academics have been of no worries and balance has been a key factor of my life.  From hosting events in Odyssey, to PR head in first year in RIISE. Hosting a national level hackathon with the assistance of Tale of Humankind and E-Cell in the campus while also being the first non-IA IRC member, I have been working dedicately to ensuring a smooth experience for the peers and seniors. I believe that through the council, I will be able to fully push through in providing to the peers, faculty and the college.   The sharpening of skills will allow me to carry these qualities outside of the campus, as well as allow me to contribute to IIIT’s name as its student.   I promise to contribute well to the campus. To its growth, to its success while listening to feedback and iterating on it.  Looking forward to everyone’s growth and success."
